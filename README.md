This repository contains sample code for using the AskDelphi API for performing custom context detection in an Electron application on Windows. The software when run will perform authentication using a URL, and will then perform a context detection. 

See https://imola-prod-api-2c3f1a34.azurewebsites.net/swagger/ui/index for the API specification
